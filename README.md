# Dawkins' Weasel Program

### Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of Richard Dawkins' Weasel program. The Weasel program is a famous example used by Dawkins in his book "The Blind Watchmaker" to illustrate the concept of cumulative selection in the process of evolution.

## Description

The Weasel program simulates the process of natural selection by evolving a target phrase through generations of random mutations and selecting the fittest offspring. In each generation, a population of candidate phrases undergoes mutations, and the fittest candidate, closest to the target phrase, is selected to produce the next generation.

## How to Run

First of all, ensure that you have Python version 3.12.0 or above installed on your machine.
To run the Weasel terminal based program, follow these steps:.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PedroYutaroUEA/dawkins_weasel_program.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd dawkins_weasel_program
3. Run the program

  ```bash
